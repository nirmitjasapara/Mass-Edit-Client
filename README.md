# Mass Edit
Mass edit is an app that allows you to 
replace words or phrases in a text with better substitutions.
These substitutions are then saved so you can use this template
for another similar text. Possible applications are: mass translations, decoding, and any time the user is repeatedly replacing the same set of words.

[Go to the app](https://mass-edit-client.vercel.app/)
